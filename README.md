# US_Census

This is my source code for the study of the US Census data set. for my application as a Data Scientist at Dataiku.

Please open the iPython Notebook 'Dataiku - US Census.ipynb'. You may execute the cells one after another; it will load the other libraries when needed. Note that I use Python 3.
